!matthew's VIM config

It's a dope config. Trust me.

Installation
============

Before installation you can cp your .vim/ and .vimrc if you are worried about them getting
blown away. The install scripts will simply move them with a `.baklava` extension in their
current directory or, if they are a symlink, simply remove the symlink to then install its
own.

Installation Commands
=====================

$ git clone https://github.com/mbaltrusitis/betavc some/path
$ cd some/path
$ git submodule update --init --recursive
$ make
